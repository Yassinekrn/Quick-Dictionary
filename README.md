## 🛠️ Inspiration & Motivation

This extension was inspired by similar tools that, unfortunately, became deprecated and non-functional over time. 😔 Many of these extensions were abandoned, leaving users without a reliable solution. This project aims to:

-   **Fix all known issues** from previous implementations.
-   **Modernize the experience** with better performance and user experience.
-   **Provide ongoing support** to ensure it remains functional and up-to-date. 🚀

Built with ❤️ and a commitment to keeping it alive for the community!
